#Detailed Minesweeper Solver Description

# Purpose #

The purpose for this document is to elaborate on the design of the Mine Sweeper Solver project using three milestones as a framework and time line. These milestones can be seen on the [Gantt Chart](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pcZ1QpE61pv04SDXKZa2rVA). For a description of the project based on components see the [Prospectus](Prospectus.md). Furthermore these elaborations have the intent of providing a general idea as to how each portion of the project will be accomplished.

# Milestones #

  * [Milestone 1](Milestone1.md): Game board
  * [Milestone 2](Milestone2.md): Virtual machine
  * [Milestone 3](Milestone3.md): Main program
  * [Post Milestones](postMilestone.md): Finishing touches

Component interaction will follow the general outline of this [UML Diagram](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dffv9tbz_3ch2v3xd3).
