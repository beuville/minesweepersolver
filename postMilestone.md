# Goals #

The goal of the this remaining time between the final milestone and the presentation is to insure our program is bug free and to generate data for and complete the final presentation.

## Testing ##

Supervisor: Group effort

It is likely that even with the main program completed and functional it will take some amount of testing/tweaking to get significant results. This testing period will give us time to not only clean up any lingering bugs but also try different settings to see their consequences on the results.

## Presentation ##

Supervisor: Group effort

This time is set aside to organize the final presentation. This presentation will include not only descriptions of our project and technical achievements but also an exploration of the results based on various initial settings.
