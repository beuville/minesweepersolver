These milestones can be seen on the [http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pcZ1QpE61pv04SDXKZa2rVA Gantt Chart]. For a description of the project based on components see the [Prospectus]. Furthermore these elaborations have the intent of providing a general idea as to how each portion of the project will be accomplished.
